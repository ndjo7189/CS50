The website provides a guide for users on how their food consumption and exercise are aligning with their needs. 
The website dynamically uses five different data-tables, calculating for specific rates and needs as needed. 
For example, the website can calculate how old you are using birthday, and using that age, 
can eventually calculate what daily caloric needs are. I've learned a lot in using SQL, 
extensively making use of unions and sub-queries, to make the calculations internally work as intended.
